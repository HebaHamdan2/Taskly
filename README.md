# Taskly – Shopping List & Task Counter

**Taskly** is a mobile app built with **React Native and Expo** that helps users organize daily tasks and manage recurring activities. The app includes a **shopping list** where users can add, edit, and delete items, with all data saved locally so it remains available even after closing the app. It also features a **recurring task counter** for activities that repeat, such as washing a car every two weeks; when a task is completed, the timer resets automatically, and if the task is overdue, the app clearly alerts the user. local **Push notifications** remind users when tasks are due or late, and a **history** screen allows viewing the last completion times. This project demonstrates practical mobile development skills including screen navigation, reusable UI components, local data persistence, time-based logic, and notification handling.
